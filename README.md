# modular_synth

this is a small experiment using the WebAudio API.
A Modular synthesizer on the web using Oscillators, filters, gainNodes, etc.
But I not only want to use the components that already come with the WebAudio API, there's for example the File Input component that reads an image and uses the array of pixel data to generate sound waves. There's also the Mouse component that reads the X and Y positions of the mouse and allows yo the user to control whatever parameters they want.
